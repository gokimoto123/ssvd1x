# Next Session Prompt - September 13, 2025 (UX Focus)

## User Background
You are working with an applied mathematician with 35 years of experience in AI and machine learning, with deep expertise in genomics and biomarker discovery. Expect discussions at a high technical level with emphasis on mathematical correctness and practical applicability to the analysis of real-world, high-dimensional datasets.

## Context Summary
The SSVD1x application is approaching functional completeness with chart click events, reset buttons, and basic single-alpha, multi-alpha, and eFDR analysis workflow all working correctly. The focus now shifts to **user experience refinements** and **navigation workflow improvements**, for the different analysis modes. 

## Session Objective
Polish UI/UX for the different analysis modes by fixing layout issues, improving information placement, and improving application workflow.

## Current Status ✅
### Successfully Completed in Previous Session
- ✅ **Chart click events working**: All three charts (FDR, Detections, Gradient) respond to clicks and execute SSVD
- ✅ **Bidirectional table-chart linking**: Selection syncs perfectly in both directions
- ✅ **Reset button functionality**: All reset buttons properly return to CSV upload page
- ✅ **Streamlined single-alpha workflow**: Configuration → Run SSVD → Direct to Results (no intermediate screens)
- ✅ **Single-alpha input improvements**: Manual entry with proper validation and complete deletion capability
- ✅ **Single-alpha state management**: Clean transitions between workflow stages

### Current Working File
- **Primary file**: `current_optimized.html` (contains all current functionality)
- **Backup created**: `current_optimized_20250913_workflow_fixes.html`
- **Read summary of last session for context**: SESSION_SUMMARY_20250913_FINAL.md

## Critical UX Issues to Fix
### Issue 1: Run Button Layout Problem for Single-Alpha Analysis ❌
**Problem**: The Run button in the Alpha Value input box is obscured by the Detections display card
**Location**: SSVD Analysis Results section → Alpha Value input area
**Impact**: Users cannot see or easily access the Run button to execute new analyses
**Required Fix**: Adjust layout spacing, card positioning, or button placement to ensure full visibility

### Issue 2: MaxAlpha Display Location for Single-Alpha Analysis ❌
**Problem**: Maximum Alpha is currently displayed in SSVD Analysis Results section
**Current Location**: SSVD Analysis Results (after running analysis)
**Desired Location**: Analysis Configuration panel that appears after running analysis above SSVD Analysis Results section
**Reasoning**: Users need to see the maximum alpha value if there is a need to rerun single-alpha analysis
**Required Fix**: Move maxAlpha to single-alpha results page in the configuration panel with proper context

### Issue 3: Single-Alpha Analysis Page titles❌
**Problem 1**: Title of page is: "SSVD Analysis Results"
**Fix 1**: Title should read: "Single-Alpha Analysis Results"
**Problem 2**: Title of U1 scatterplot is: "U1 vector - Sparsified Left Singular Vector"
**Fix 2**: Title should read: "Sparse Left-Singular Vector U1"
**Problem 3**: Title of V1 line plot is: "V1 Vector - Dense Signal Pattern"
**Fix 3**: Title Should Read: "Dense Right-Singular Vector V1 Supported by U1

### Issue 5: "New Analysis" Button for Single-Alpha Results❌
**Problem**: No way to return to "Choose Analysis Type" page from single-alpha results page
**Fix 1**: Place "New Analysis" button somewhere on the single-alpha results page

### Issue 6: Single-Alpha Analysis Configuration Page❌
**Problem1**: "Back to Data Review" isn't needed
**Fix1**: Remove "Back to Data Review" button
**Problem2**: "Run SSVD Analysis" button
**Fix2**: "Run SSVD Analysis" button should read "Run Analysis"
**Problem3**: "Alpha Value (sparsity parameter)" box initializes with a nonsense number
**Fix3**: Initialize the Alpha Value (sparsity parameter) box with a blank

## Specific Technical Requirements

### For Issue 1 (Run Button Layout)
- Investigate current CSS grid layout in SSVD results section
- Ensure Run button has adequate spacing and visibility
- Test across different screen sizes
- Maintain responsive design principles

### For Issue 2 (MaxAlpha Location)
- Remove maxAlpha display from SSVD Results section
- Add maxAlpha to Analysis Configuration panel (single-alpha mode)
- Ensure proper context: "Maximum Alpha (threshold for zero detections)"
- Use appropriate styling that doesn't interfere with input fields

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Fixes (Issues 1-3)
- ✅ Run button on Results page fully visible and accessible
- ✅ MaxAlpha displayed in configuration panel of results section 
- ✅ No layout regressions or functionality loss
- ✅ Responsive design maintained across screen sizes

## File References
- **Current working file**: `current_optimized.html`
- **Session summary**: `SESSION_SUMMARY_20250913_FINAL.md`
- **Project guidelines**: `CLAUDE.md`
- **Previous session documentation**: Available for context

## Testing Approach
1. **Layout testing**: Verify Run button visibility across different viewport sizes
2. **Navigation testing**: Test all workflow transitions and back-navigation paths
3. **Functionality testing**: Ensure all existing features continue working after changes
4. **User flow testing**: Walk through complete single-alpha analysis workflow

## Important Notes
- **Preserve all existing functionality** - these are refinement changes, not rebuilds
- **Maintain mathematical correctness** - no changes to algorithm behavior
- **Focus on single-alpha workflow** as the primary user experience target
- **Discuss Issue 4 before implementation** to ensure proper approach

## Quick Start Instructions
1. Load `current_optimized.html` 
2. Test single-alpha analysis workflow to understand current UX issues
3. Fix Issues systematically

The goal is to create a polished, intuitive single-alpha analysis experience that guides users smoothly through the workflow while maintaining all the robust functionality already in place.
