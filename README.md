# SSVD1x - Sparse Singular Value Decomposition Analysis Tool

A web-based application for **Sparse Singular Value Decomposition (SSVD)** with **empirical False Discovery Rate (eFDR)** analysis, designed for biomarker discovery in high-dimensional data matrices.

## Overview

SSVD1x is a research tool that identifies a small subset of matrix rows (variables) from thousands that contain a common signal of interest using L1 regularization. The tool is particularly useful for high-dimensional data analysis where the number of variables greatly exceeds the number of samples.

## Features

- **Data Upload**: Support for CSV and other tabular data formats
- **SSVD Algorithm**: Sparse matrix factorization with L1 regularization
- **eFDR Analysis**: Empirical False Discovery Rate estimation using permutation testing
- **Alpha Path Analysis**: Detection analysis across multiple sparsity parameters
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Real-time parameter adjustment and result visualization
- **Export Capabilities**: Download results in various formats

## Quick Start

### Running the Application

```bash
# Start the web server (Python 3)
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Navigate to http://localhost:8000 in your browser
# Open current_optimized.html
```

### Alternative Methods
```bash
npm start
npm run dev
npm run serve
```

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with JSX (Babel Standalone transformation)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + custom CSS
- **Algorithms**: Pure JavaScript implementation (no external math libraries)
- **Performance**: Web Worker for parallel permutation testing
- **Deployment**: Static HTML file, no build process required

### Core Algorithms
- `svd1()`: Power iteration method for singular value decomposition
- `SSVDR1Algorithm()`: Sparse SVD with iterative soft thresholding
- `runFDRAnalysis()`: Permutation-based FDR analysis
- `permuteMatrixRows()`: Matrix row permutation for null hypothesis testing

### Mathematical Background
The application implements sparse SVD for biomarker discovery in P Ã— N data matrices where:
- P >> N (many more variables than samples)
- K << P (sparse embedded signal)
- Typical applications include genomics, proteomics, and medical diagnostics
